    "## Understanding Interleaved Thinking / 理解交错思维\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Interleaved Thinking? / 什么是交错思维？\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaved thinking is a new capability in Claude 4 models that allows the model to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Think between tool calls**: Process and reason about results before deciding next steps\n",
    "2. **Chain multiple tools with reasoning**: Make sophisticated multi-step decisions\n",
    "3. **Adapt strategies dynamically**: Change approach based on intermediate results\n",
    "\n",
    "交错思维是 Claude 4 模型的一项新功能，允许模型：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **在工具调用之间思考**：在决定下一步之前处理和推理结果\n",
    "2. **通过推理链接多个工具**：做出复杂的多步决策\n",
    "3. **动态调整策略**：根据中间结果改变方法\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works / 工作原理\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of similarities between Agent's event loop implemented with and without interleaved thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "在有交错思维和没有交错思维的代理事件循环实现之间有很多相似之处:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query → LLM is thinking -> LLM decides to call a Tool -> Event Loop calls the Tool -> Ouput is sent back to LLM -> [ this continues until LLM no longer needs to call any tools - it rendered the Final Answer ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference you'll notice with the interleaved thinking is that Event loop is acting on LLM's \"thoughts\", rather than \"decisions\". Notice the second link in the loop above, called \"thinking\". In a traditional event loop, the thoughts are hidden. We have to wait until LLM renders either a decision to call a tool or produces the Final Answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "交错思维的主要区别在于事件循环作用于 LLM 的“思考”，而不是“决策”。注意上面循环中的第二个环节，称为“思考”。在传统的事件循环中，思考是隐藏的。我们必须等到 LLM 做出调用工具的决策或产生最终答案。\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of interleaved thinking, LLM is \"leaking\" its thoughts into the even loop while it's still in that second step - \"LLM is thinking\" - and event loop is configured to executed the tools as soon as LLM \"thinks\" about doing it. What this means is that by the time LLM is done thinking, it actually has the Final Answer, on the very first \"decision\". \n",
    "\n",
    "在交错思维的情况下，LLM 在仍处于第二步“LLM 正在思考”时将其思考“泄露”到事件循环中，事件循环被配置为一旦 LLM“想到”就执行工具。这意味着当 LLM 完成思考时，它实际上在第一个“决策”中就有了最终答案。\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling Interleaved Thinking / 启用交错思维\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature with Strands and Bedrock:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set `temperature=1` (required when thinking is enabled)\n",
    "- Add beta header: `\"anthropic_beta\": [\"interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14\"]`\n",
    "- Configure reasoning budget: `\"reasoning_config\": {\"type\": \"enabled\", \"budget_tokens\": 3000}`\n",
    "\n",
    "要在 Strands 和 Bedrock 中启用此功能：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 设置 `temperature=1`（启用思考时必需）\n",
    "- 添加 beta 头：`\"anthropic_beta\": [\"interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14\"]`\n",
    "- 配置推理预算：`\"reasoning_config\": {\"type\": \"enabled\", \"budget_tokens\": 3000}`"
