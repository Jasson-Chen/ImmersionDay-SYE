    "# Unstructured and Structured RAG with Intelligent Query Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an advanced RAG pattern that intelligently routes queries between **structured** and **unstructured** knowledge bases using **Strands Agents** \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses custom retrieval tools that connect to Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases:\n",
    "1. **Query Analysis**: Agent analyzes incoming query to determine type\n",
    "2. **Tool Selection**: Routes to unstructured (document) or structured (SQL) assistant\n",
    "3. **Retrieval**: Appropriate knowledge base retrieves relevant information\n",
    "4. **Response Generation**: Agent synthesizes and presents the results\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables handling both qualitative questions (business strategy, policies) and quantitative queries (financial metrics, data analysis) within a single conversational interface."
